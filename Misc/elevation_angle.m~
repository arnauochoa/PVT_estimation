% ELEVATION ANGLE:  Computes the elevation angle of the satellite over

% Input:
%           r_u:    Vector defining the user's position.
%           r_s:    Vector defining the satellite's position.
% Input:
%           alpha:  Angle expressed in rad of the satellite over
%                   the horizon with respect to the user's position.
